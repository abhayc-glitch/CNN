# This function is exactly like a line.
# HEllA linear
# A linear function is simply the equation of a line. It will appear as a straight line when graphed,
# where y = x and the output value equals the input.
#This activation function is usually applied to the last layer’s output in the case of a regression model — a model that outputs a scalar value instead of a classification.
# Y = mx + b
# y = x
