"""
With a randomly-initialized model, or even a model initialized with more sophisticated
approaches, our goal is to train, or teach, a model over time. To train a model, we tweak the
weights and biases to improve the model’s accuracy and confidence. To do this, we calculate how
much error the model has. The loss function, also referred to as the cost function, is the
algorithm that quantifies how wrong a model is. Loss is the measure of this metric. Since loss is
the model’s error, we ideally want it to be 0.

# Basically it talks to the Netowrk and it tells it how bad it did. Like a test score.

# Preferably we could clssify a (True, False) and then tell the network how correct he is (50% cux only true or false).
# We cant do that becasue we want the network to be confident in tis answer.
# As you can probably guess there are diffrebt types of Loss functions
# The softmax function outputs a probability distro so we need to Calculate loss with something that only comapres prob distros
