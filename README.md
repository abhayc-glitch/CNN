# NeuralNetwork ðŸ§ 
This is me creating a Neural Network from scratch in python following Sentdex's book and Youtube Series. 
All of this is in python. I didnt follwo it word for word, i did add my touch to it but there you have it.

NOTE : I am reviewing OOPS while making this network and I have those files in a OOP folder. (DONT OPEN IT IF YOU DONT CARE)
The files that have a p.(x) are files that are lesson topics the other ones are wtv i have no clue. 

#MY Final netowrk will be in a Seperate folder IDK what the constraint is yet!
